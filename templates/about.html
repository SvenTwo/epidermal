	<p>Stomata Counter started as a collaboration between the University of Vermont, Brown Univeristy, and the Smithsonian Institution. During Karl's dissertation, he was face with counting stomata from several thousand images and became determined not to do it manually. At GSA in 2016, Karl and Sven met and came up with a draft version of a CNN to estiamte counts of stomata. The extensive biological collections at the National Museum of Natural History and the United States Botanic garden were instrumental in extending the training data set to species outside if <i>Populus</i>.</p>
